Implementing Routes: Create routes for different functionalities like user authentication (login and signup), managing elections (creation, deletion), voting, etc. These routes will handle incoming requests and interact with your database through controllers.

Controllers: Write controller functions to handle the business logic of your application. These functions will be called by your routes to perform actions like creating users, logging in users, creating elections, casting votes, etc.

Middleware: Implement middleware functions to handle tasks like authentication and authorization. Middleware functions can intercept incoming requests, perform checks (e.g., verify JWT tokens), and either allow the request to proceed or deny it based on certain conditions.

Testing: Test your application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected. You can use tools like Postman for API testing and Jest for unit testing.

Frontend Development: Start working on the frontend of your application. Create UI components, implement user interfaces for login, signup, creating elections, voting, etc. Use frameworks like React.js for building dynamic and interactive web interfaces.

Integration: Integrate your backend with the frontend. Make API requests from your frontend components to your backend routes to fetch data and perform actions.

Deployment: Once your application is complete and tested, deploy it to a production environment. You can use platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for deployment.
